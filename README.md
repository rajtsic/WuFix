1. **Download the Script:** Download the script file to your computer.

2. **Double-Click to Run:** Locate the downloaded script file and double-click on it. The script will automatically request and acquire administrative rights and proceed with optimization tasks.



## Script Variants

The script comes in two variants: "onlyWufix" and "Normal," each serving different purposes.

### onlyWufix

The "onlyWufix" variant mainly performs the following tasks:

- Checks for admin rights and elevates permissions if necessary.
- Creates a system restore point.
- Deletes temporary files.
- Resets BITS (Background Intelligent Transfer Service).
- Runs DISM (Deployment Imaging Service and Management Tool) scan.
- Executes SFC (System File Checker) scan.
- Reboots the system.
- Runs a chkdsk scan.

This script is effective in resolving Windows update issues and serves as a general system maintenance tool.

### Normal

The "Normal" variant does more for system performance and is targeted towards business and enterprise end-user computers but can be used by any Windows user. In addition to the tasks performed by "onlyWufix," the "Normal" script also:

- Stops and disables startup Xbox-related services.
- Disables Cortana (End of Life).
- Enables the use of the Print Screen button to open the Snipping Tool.
- Enables Storage Sense and configures basic settings.
- Customizes visual effects for enhanced performance.
- Enables Processor Performance Boost mode (if compatible hardware is present).
- Sets minimum and maximum processor states to 100% when plugged in.

## Important Notes

This script makes significant changes to your system settings, services, and configurations. Only use it if you are confident in its effects.

## Runtime

The script may take some time to complete, depending on your system's hardware and the tasks being performed. On average, it takes about 20-30 minutes to run within CMD. 
The script will prompt you to reboot, and after that, the chkdsk scan can take an additional 20-30 minutes or even longer.
